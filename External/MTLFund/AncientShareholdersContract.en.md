# Ancient Shareholders Contract

1. Due to changes in the offer associated with the Fund’s refusal to guarantee buybacks at book value in the future at the level of a strictly permanent written contract in the future, in order to decouple the market value of its shares from its book value and allow it to go up, the problem arose of the Fund’s guarantees to fulfill these obligations retrospectively, within the past value of the contract in relation to shareholders who purchased shares before changes in the basic offer of MTL tokens.

2. To eliminate these concerns, this closed contract is used between the MTL Fund and a circle of persons - its shareholders who purchased MTL tokens before the offer was changed.

3. By this unilateral agreement, the Fund guarantees to old shareholders who purchased their shares before the change in the offer from 16th March 2024, the purchase from them, upon request, during the quarter of MTL tokens at the then book price of 4.43 EURMTL (provided that the real book value of the fund’s assets is not lower), including to the extent that they owned them at that time, provided that they maintain the continuity of this process.

4. Changing the account - the holder of assets with the transfer of these legal obligations to it is possible if both of these accounts have been verified by the Association as affiliated or duplicate structures.

5. The execution of this guarantee does not relate to loans, but to shareholder law, therefore, in case of difficulties, the provision of buybacks will still occur last in comparison with the external commercial obligations of the Fund, and in the event that the real book price of MTL shares at that time will be lower the one indicated in paragraph 3 - the execution of this contract will take place at the real cost.

6. The current version of this contract may be superseded by a qualified majority of the signatories of the funds and stored in the repositories of the associations as an additional guarantee of the fulfillment of these obligations.
