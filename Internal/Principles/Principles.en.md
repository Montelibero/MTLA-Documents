# Principles of the Montelibero Association

We, the participants of the Montelibero Association, define the basic principles that guide our decisions and describe
our activities within the Association. As co-authors of the activities on the Association's platforms, and especially as
its representatives, we are guided by these principles.

## 1. Self-Ownership and the Non-Aggression Principle

We believe that people belong only to themselves. Therefore, we strive to expand the individual sovereignty of each
person. We adhere to the non-aggression principle and oppose aggressive violence, deception and coercion.

## 2. Freedom of Association

We support freedom of association and the autonomy of contractual jurisdictions within and outside the Association. We
preserve the right of any part of the Association to secede and we develop fair and transparent procedures for dividing
property and liabilities.

## 3. The Golden Rule and Equality

We treat others as we wouldn't mind to be treated. Every interaction should be equal and voluntary, as far as agreements
allow it, and responsibility should be proportional to the act.

## 4. Pluralism

We reject the monopoly on truth and acknowledge that our point of view is limited by our experience. We don't make
decisions on behalf of others and we respect their right to make their own choices.

## 5. The Support for Local Communities

The development and security of Montelibero's territorial communities are a priority for us, as participants of the
Montelibero movement.

## 6. Creation

We change the world and create without waiting for permission or orders, and we eliminate obstacles to active
participation.

## 7. Subsidiarity and Decentralization

We distribute powers and responsibilities in the Association as much as possible without losing effectiveness. We do not
make decisions without the participation of those affected.

## 8. Openness

We strive for transparency in the Association's activities if it does not threaten the safety or privacy of people. We
maintain simplicity, conciseness and clarity in the Association's procedures and rules.

## 9. Ecology

We protect the environment, because we realize it affects everyone.

## 10. Solidarity

We recognize those who share these principles as our allies. We favor the peaceful resolution of conflicts within the
Montelibero movement by accepting the presumption of good intentions of participants.
